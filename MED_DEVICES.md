## About the various models of MED Devices

There are slow but bias amplified devices that usually come in a black or a translucent turqoise enclosure about the size of a thumb drive. They are all designed to output near 100KHz for easy comparison, except the 4MHz random generators I sent out originally (without labels) and MED1Kx3.

The faster devices come in a black metal enclosure with a USB cable.

* The serial numbers can be read by a program since they are used to register the device to be read by the USB interface. 
* The last 3 digits of the S/N are just sequential numbers from 1 to 999 to make each one unique. 
* QWR is part of the S/N that is recognized by the MeterFeeder interface program so it doesnâ€™t connect to some other device that uses FTDI USB interface chips.

*This device is intended to compare with other generators used in the Global Consciousness Project (GCP), which output 1 Kbps. So far only one person has this generator tasked with the comparison for future GCP installations.
